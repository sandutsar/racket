  ;; Compute a native or pbarch machine string for the current platform.
  ;; Some caveats:
  ;;  1. A pbarch Racket will always infer a pbarch machine,
  ;;     even if a native machine exists. Hopefully this is an
  ;;     unlikely scenario: if you're running Racket CS, you've
  ;;     bootstrapped Chez somehow, so you could use `re.boot`.
  ;;  2. A `tpb` or `pb` Racket on a 32-bit platform would still return
  ;;     64 from `(system-type 'word)`, but, in addition to the above,
  ;;     it is not currently possible or desired to build Racket as
  ;;     `tpb` or `pb` (as opposed to pbarch variants):
  ;;     see <https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/4692>.
  ;;  3. On a hypothetical platform where Chez supported both the
  ;;     architecture and the OS, but not the combination of the two,
  ;;     (e.g. riscv64 Windows) this code would currently return a
  ;;     non-existent native machine (e.g. trv64nt) instead of a
  ;;     working pbarch machine. Presumably this could be fixed if
  ;;     such a platform came into existence.
